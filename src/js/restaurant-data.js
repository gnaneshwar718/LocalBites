    <p><strong>Since 1924</strong>, Mavalli Tiffin Rooms (MTR) has been a cornerstone of Bengaluru’s culinary heritage. Founded by the Maiya brothers from Udupi, it originally began as the Brahmin Coffee Club before being renamed MTR. Over the decades, MTR has become legendary not just for its food, but for its role in shaping South Indian breakfast culture.</p>
    <p>MTR is famously credited with the invention of the <strong>Rava Idli</strong> during <strong>World War II</strong>, when rice was scarce due to wartime shortages. To adapt, they created a new recipe using semolina (rava), giving birth to what is now one of India’s most loved breakfast dishes.</p>
    <p>Their <strong>Masala Dosa</strong> is iconic — thick, dark-roasted, crisp on the outside, and rich in flavor. Served with generous amounts of ghee, spicy potato filling, and their signature chutneys, it offers a taste that has remained unchanged for generations.</p>

      <p><strong>Central Tiffin Room (CTR)</strong>, now known as Shri Sagar, is a pilgrimage site for dosa lovers in Malleshwaram. Famous for its <strong>Benne Masala Dosa</strong>, this 90-year-old establishment serves dosas that are the definition of "crispy on the outside, soft on the inside."</p>
      <p>The dosas here are known for their golden-brown, glass-like crunch, achieved by a generous slathering of butter (benne). They are traditionally wood-fired, giving them a distinct smoky aroma. Served with two types of chutney—coconut and spicy mint—CTR’s dosas are simple but unforgettable.</p>

      <p>Their Masala Dosa is unique: thick, fatty, and distinctly brown, folded in half with a dollop of potato palya inside. The sight of waiters deftly balancing stacks of 10-15 dosa plates on one arm is almost as famous as the food itself. The rustic charm, old photographs on the walls, and the bustling energy make eating here a quintessential Bengaluru experience.</p>
